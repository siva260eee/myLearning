## 🎯 How to Use This

### For Each Module (Repeat 8 Times)

**Step 1: Read Concepts (10-15 minutes)**
```
Open: XX_Module/CONCEPTS.md
- Understand the theory
- See Java-to-Python comparisons
- Note key differences
```

**Step 2: Study Examples (20-30 minutes)**
```
Open: XX_Module/examples.py
- Read the code
- Run it: python examples.py
- Modify lines and test
- Understand execution flow
```

**Step 3: Do Exercises (60-90 minutes)**
```
Open: XX_Module/EXERCISES.md
- Create: XX_Module/my_solutions.py
- Write code yourself (no copy-paste!)
- Test with different inputs
- Fix bugs using DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md
```

**Step 4: Consolidate (15-20 minutes)**
```
- Review what you learned
- Add comments to your code
- Refactor if needed
- Prepare for next module
```

## 🆘 Quick Help

**"I don't understand a concept"**
→ Re-read CONCEPTS.md
→ Run and modify examples.py
→ See it in action

**"My code isn't working"**
→ Read the error message carefully
→ Check DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md
→ Use print() to debug

**"I'm stuck on an exercise"**
→ Go back to examples.py
→ Break the problem into steps
→ Write pseudocode first

**"I can't run Python"**
→ Install from python.org
→ Or use VS Code's built-in Python
→ Restart VS Code after install
